## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code was implemented in Python 3.8 and need `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `gensim`, `seaborn`. I highly recommend you update the lastest version for best performance.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using  Seattle AirBnb data to better understand:

1. How Seattle AirBnb price change by time (week, month)?
2. What are the factors that impact to the price of the house?
3. Reviews of user about Seattle AirBnb experience?
4. Build a model to predict price of room by room's features?

For more information and full dataset of Seattle AirBnB can be found at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle?resource=download)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

All code was contains in [Airbnb-Seattle-EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/winterlovet44/Break-into-the-Seattle-Airbnb/blob/main/Airbnb-Seattle-EDA.ipynb). 

Dataset for this code was contained at folder `data`.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@haupham2539/615e2d8f929e).
